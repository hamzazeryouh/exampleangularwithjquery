<p>We need a framework like Angular and other modern JavaScript frameworks for several : <br>

  Modularity and Structure: Angular provides a structured and modular way to build web applications. It encourages the use of components, services, and modules, making it easier to organize and maintain the codebase. <br>
  
  Two-Way Data Binding: Angular offers powerful two-way data binding, where changes to the model (data) automatically update the view and vice versa. This simplifies the process of keeping the UI in sync with the underlying data. <br>
  
  Dependency Injection: Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that helps manage and organize the application's components and services effectively. This promotes code reusability and makes testing easier. <br>
  
  Routing: Angular provides a router module that allows developers to create single-page applications with multiple views and manage client-side navigation. <br>
  
  TypeScript: Angular is built on TypeScript, which introduces static typing and enhances code reliability and IDE tooling. It provides better error-checking and code auto-completion, leading to fewer bugs and faster development.
  
  Testing Support: Angular comes with robust testing tools and utilities, making it easier to write unit tests and ensure the reliability of your code. <br>
  
  <span > When to use jQuery instead:</span><br>
  
  Simple DOM Manipulation: If you have a small project that requires minimal DOM manipulation, jQuery can be a lightweight and quick solution. It simplifies tasks like selecting and modifying elements on the page. <br>
  
  Cross-Browser Compatibility: jQuery abstracts away many browser-specific quirks and inconsistencies, making it easier to write code that works across different browsers. <br>
  
  AJAX Requests: jQuery provides easy-to-use functions for making AJAX requests, allowing you to fetch and manipulate data from the server without a full-fledged framework. <br>
  
  Animation Effects: If your project requires simple animation effects, jQuery provides an easy-to-use animation API. <br>
  
  Simple example:
</p>
<app-animation></app-animation>
